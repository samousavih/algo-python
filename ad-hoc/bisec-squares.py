Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis.

Each square consists of three values, the coordinate of bottom left corner [X,Y] = [square[0],square[1]], and the side length of the square square[2].
The line will intersect to the two squares in four points. Return the coordinates of two intersection points [X1,Y1] and [X2,Y2] that the forming segment covers the other two intersection points in format of {X1,Y1,X2,Y2}. If X1 != X2, there should be X1 < X2, otherwise there should be Y1 <= Y2.

If there are more than one line that can cut these two squares in half, return the one that has biggest slope (slope of a line parallel to the y-axis is considered as infinity).

Example:

Input: 


square1 = {-1, -1, 2}


square2 = {0, -1, 2}


Output: {-1,0,2,0}


Explanation: y = 0 is the line that can cut these two squares in half.


Note:

square.length == 3
square[2] > 0
