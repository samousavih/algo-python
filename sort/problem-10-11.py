"""
Peaks and Valleys:In an array of integers,a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent inteÂ­gers.
For example, in the array {5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks and {5, 2} are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
EXAMPLE
Input: {5, 3, 1, 2, 3}
Output: {5, 1, 3, 2, 3}
